# vim-evolution
A colour scheme for Vim.

The aim is to provide obvious and clear colours for syntax highlighting, with
colouring for non-text objects that is useful, easy on the eyes and stays out
of the way. This is a dark theme, which is also designed to work well with a
semi-transparent background. I use it with the Termite terminal emulator.

I have strongly protanomalous colour blindness, and most existing colour
schemes don't distinguish sufficiently for me to be able to rely intuitively on
syntax highlighting. Other colour schemes that do distinguish well are often
too garish and hard on the eyes. This is my own attempt at something which is
sufficient differentiable for strongly protanomolous users, without being hard
on the eyes.

Supports 256 colour terminals and gvim.
